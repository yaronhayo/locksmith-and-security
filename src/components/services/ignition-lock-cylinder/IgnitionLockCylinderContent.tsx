          <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Difficulty Inserting the Key</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            If your key doesn't slide smoothly into the ignition cylinder, there may be damage or wear to the internal components.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Common Causes of Ignition Lock Cylinder Failure</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Understanding what causes ignition problems can help you prevent future issues:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Normal Wear and Tear</strong> - Over time, the constant insertion and removal of keys causes internal wear</li>
        <li><strong>Key Damage</strong> - Bent or damaged keys can damage the internal components of the ignition cylinder</li>
        <li><strong>Dirt and Debris</strong> - Foreign materials can enter the cylinder and interfere with its operation</li>
        <li><strong>Attempted Theft</strong> - Damage from break-in attempts can compromise the ignition system</li>
        <li><strong>Manufacturing Defects</strong> - Some vehicles have known issues with their ignition systems</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div className="bg-primary/5 p-6 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-primary my-8">
        <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Professional Tip</h4>
        <p>
          Don't overload your key ring with heavy items. The weight of a heavy key chain hanging from the ignition can cause premature wear on the ignition cylinder and tumblers, potentially leading to ignition problems.
