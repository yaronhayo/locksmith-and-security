  // FAQs about lock rekeying
  const faqs = [
    {
      question: "What is lock rekeying?",
      answer: "Lock rekeying is the process of changing the internal pins in your lock cylinder so that your existing keys will no longer work, and a new key will be needed. This is more affordable than replacing the entire lock, and is ideal when you want to maintain the same lock hardware but need to change who has access."
    },
    {
      question: "When should I rekey my locks?",
      answer: "You should consider rekeying your locks when you move into a new home, lose a key, have a roommate move out, after a break-in attempt, when keys are stolen, or when you want to have just one key for multiple locks. It's a security measure that helps you control access to your property."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the lock rekeying process take?",
      answer: "The lock rekeying process typically takes about 10-15 minutes per lock. If you have multiple locks that need to be rekeyed, our professional locksmith can usually complete the job efficiently. The entire service call, including assessment and rekeying, usually takes about 30-60 minutes depending on the number of locks."
    },
    {
      question: "Can all locks be rekeyed?",
      answer: "Most standard locks can be rekeyed, including deadbolts, doorknobs, lever handles, and many high-security locks. However, some very old or damaged locks may not be suitable for rekeying. Our locksmith will assess your locks and recommend the best optionâ€”whether it's rekeying or replacement."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it cheaper to rekey or replace locks?",
      answer: "Rekeying is generally more cost-effective than replacing locks, especially if your existing hardware is in good condition. When you rekey, you're only changing the internal components that match the key pattern, while keeping the existing lock hardware. Lock replacement involves installing entirely new hardware, which typically costs more."
